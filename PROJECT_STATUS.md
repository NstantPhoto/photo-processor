## Performance Status

Current capabilities:
- ‚úÖ Hot folder detection: <2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Basic processing: Functional but not optimized
- ‚ùå Small images (<5MP): Target <0.5s (not tested)
- ‚ùå Medium images (5-20MP): Target <2s (not tested)
- ‚ùå Large images (20-100MP): Target <10s (not tested)
- ‚ùå Batch processing: Target 100+ images/hour (not implemented)

## Next Steps

1. Add GPU acceleration with CuPy
2. Implement export pipeline
3. Create preview generation system
4. Connect frontend node editor to backend pipeline
5. Add remaining AI models
6. Performance optimization and benchmarking

## Technical Debt

- Need to implement actual image processing in hot folder (currently just queues)
- Pipeline execution from frontend not connected
- No error recovery in chunk processing
- Missing progress reporting to frontend
- Session management backend integration incomplete
