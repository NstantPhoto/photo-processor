## Performance Status

Current capabilities:
- ✅ Hot folder detection: <2 seconds
- ✅ Basic processing: ~180ms per image (tested)
- ✅ Preview generation: <10ms cached, ~100ms uncached
- ✅ Pipeline execution: ~30ms for simple pipelines
- ❌ Small images (<5MP): Target <0.5s (not tested)
- ❌ Medium images (5-20MP): Target <2s (not tested)
- ❌ Large images (20-100MP): Target <10s (not tested)
- ❌ Batch processing: Target 100+ images/hour (implemented but not optimized)

## Next Steps

1. Implement export pipeline with format support
2. Add GPU acceleration with CuPy
3. Add remaining AI models (Deep White Balance, U²-Net, Real-ESRGAN)
4. Implement advanced processors (noise reduction, sharpening, etc.)
5. Performance optimization and benchmarking
6. Add comprehensive testing suite

## Technical Debt

- Need to implement actual image processing in hot folder (currently just queues)
- No error recovery in chunk processing
- Missing real-time progress reporting to frontend
- Session management backend integration incomplete
- Preview URLs need proper asset protocol handling
- Need to implement validate_pipeline command in Tauri
