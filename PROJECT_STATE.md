## ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### 1. Microkernel Architecture (2025-06-26)
**Decision:** Use microkernel pattern with plugin modules
**Rationale:** 
- Allows modular development
- Easy to add new processors
- Better testing isolation
- Performance through specialization
**Patterns Established:** 
- All processors inherit from BaseProcessor
- Nodes communicate via standardized interfaces

### 2. IPC Strategy (2025-06-26)
**Decision:** MessagePack for small data, memory-mapped files for images
**Rationale:**
- MessagePack is fast and compact
- Memory-mapped files avoid copying large images
- SSE for real-time progress updates
**Patterns Established:**
- Never send raw image data through IPC
- Always use paths for image references

### 3. Memory Management (2025-06-26)
**Decision:** Tiled processing with dynamic chunk sizing
**Rationale:**
- Handle 100MP images on 8GB RAM
- Prevents out-of-memory crashes
- Seamless output with overlap blending
**Patterns Established:**
- 2048x2048 base tile size
- 128px overlap for blending
- Dynamic sizing based on available RAM

### 4. UI Framework (2025-06-26)
**Decision:** Glass morphism with neon accents
**Rationale:**
- Modern, professional appearance
- High dopamine satisfaction
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Smooth animations enhance UX
**Patterns Established:**
- Blue (#00d4ff) and red (#ff3366) accent colors
- 20px border radius on all panels
- Backdrop blur for depth

### 5. State Management (2025-06-26)
**Decision:** Zustand with persistence
**Rationale:**
- Simple, performant state management
- Built-in persistence
- TypeScript support
- Small bundle size
**Patterns Established:**
- Separate stores for workflow, UI, and processing state
- Persist user workflows and settings
